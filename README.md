**Code Challenge 1: Gibberish Generator**

Challenge Overview
------------------

**Your response to this challenge will be used to supplement your SWEAP application.  Before you begin the application process, ensure you meet the other minimum requirements by visiting [here](http://gecapital.com/sweap "SWEAP Home Page").**


We are exticed taht you are intsereted in joiinng the Soawtfre Engreeniing Appsecitnerhip Prargom.  Weoclme to yuor fsrit prommarging chanellge.  Yuor chnellage is to courtsnct a prrgoam taht tekas an Enilgsh txet snirtg as iupnt and rerutns rebadale giirebbsh lkie tihs.  It dsenoâ€™t mtaetr in waht oerdr the ltteres in a wrod are, but an iproamtnt tihng is taht the frsit and lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae. The rset can be a taotl mses and you can sitll raed it whotuit a pboerlm.  Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe.

The Basics:
* You may use *any* programming language... it's your choice
* Your program should leave the first and last letter of each word in place and scramble the rest.
* Your program should not scamble punctuation (.,-'...etc.), numbers, or upper-case abbreviations.  
   * For example gibberish, see the /textfiles folder.  Two sample output files are provided: `xxx.txt.gib`
* Name your program as follows: _`gibgen.xx`_ (where xx is variable based on the language you choose)
* Your program should be able to read text input from a plain text file passed as an argument **or** a string passed directly
   * `gibgen.xx "This is a String"`
   * `gibgen.xx -f mystringfile.txt`
   * `cat mystringfile.txt | gibgen.xx`
* Your program should output via STDOUT.

_Note: This challenge is based on a popular word gibberish meme. You can improve the readability by looking at a [researcher's take](http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/cmabridge/) on the truths/myths of this meme, but this is not required._

What to do
----------
1. [Download](http://git-scm.com/downloads) & install Git on your machine
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this project
2. Clone your new fork'd repository to your local machine - `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/cc-gegibgen.git`
3. Complete the code challenge and fill out the Quick Start & Questions in the the README (see below)
4. `git add` and `git commit` your local repository as you go
4. Push your code and README back to GitHub occasionally - `git push origin master`
5. When you submit your cover letter, include the Commit URL to your fork'd repository that you want reviewed
   - Go here: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/cc-gegibgen/commits`
   - Find the commit that you'd like us to review, and click the "Browse Code ->" link for that commit
   - Copy and paste the URL into the cover letter... it should look something like this:
       - `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/cc-gegibgen/tree/73f0c8e2...hash.hash.hash...e804a72b6`

_Note: If you already submitted your application, ... will add instructions here._

Judging Criteria
----------------

Your responses to the **Coding Questions** at the bottom of this README are the *Most Important* part of this challenge.  
A working, fully fault-tolerant program that we just can't break, albeit awesome, is the least important.  Why is that?  
Remember, we don't expect you to be expert programmers (just yet)... We want to see how you think through a problem.  

Take a breath and just give it your best effort!
